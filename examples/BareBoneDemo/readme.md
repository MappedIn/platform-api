Bare Bone Demo
--------------

This simple demo shows you what exactly you get from a bare bone map view. This
exists to illustrate what functionality is provided by the Map view and to not
get surprised by the more fleshed out demo that purpose is to show functionality
found inside of the SDK. This is Mapview that you will likely see if you start
from scratch integrating the Mappedin SDK.

Before you load it the first time, you will need to edit index.js and input your
Mappedin Key, Secret, and Venue ID. Then, start an HTTP server in this
directory, and open index.html.
