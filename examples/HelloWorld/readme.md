This simple sample shows you the minimal code to load a venue into a MapView. The Mappedin Web SDK provides many ways to interact with the MapView and map data, but as this sample demonstrates, there is no built-in UI or default map interactions. You have complete flexibility over the behaviour, look and feel of applications built using the SDK.

Use this sample to start off if you want to integrate with the Mappedin Web SDK from scratch. Take a look at the other samples in this repo for sample code on how to use a few of the key features the SDK provides.

To get you started we've provided a key and secret that has access to some demo venues. Input your own Mappedin Key, Secret, and Venue ID in index.js to load your own Mappedin data. Then, start an HTTP server in this directory, and open index.html.
