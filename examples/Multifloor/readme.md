Multifloor Demo
-----------

This Multifloor Demo shows some of the configuration options available for our multifloor navigator class. The "Starter Sample" still supports multifloor wayfinding and path drawing, but the navigator shows multiple floors in the same view. This may be desirable for a large display application like a directory that can fit a stack of floors in a single view. To show one floor at a time in navigation, take a look at "Starter Sample".

Start an HTTP server in this directory, and open index.html. You'll need to enter your Mappedin Key and Secret and Venue ID into the UI fields provided. Input your own Mappedin Key, Secret, and Venue ID in index.js to load your own Mappedin data. To get stared you can use the following key and secret that has access to some demo venues.
